Although it’s safe, you probably get plenty from the foods you eat. Eggs, wheat germ, and mushrooms all contain a high amount of biotin. Don’t worry so much about putting it on your scalp. While many hair products boast that they contain it, there’s not much proof that your hair loss will be helped by them.

Your body doesn’t have a way to store zinc, so you need some in your diet every day. If your levels are low, there’s some proof that taking zinc by mouth could help with hair loss, but more research is needed. Your doctor will likely have you try other treatments first.

                    <p>Sandalwood, lavender, rosemary, and thyme oils have been used to treat hair loss for over 100 years. A compound in them is thought to boost hair growth. You can try rubbing one or more of these oils into your scalp for at least 2 minutes every night. Then, wrap your head in a warm towel to help it absorb. A bonus: This nightly massage smells good and can help you feel more relaxed.

                    <h1>Selenium</h1>
                    <p>Some hair growth supplements contain a nutrient called selenium. It can help your body fight off any toxins you’re exposed to (like through smoking or unclean air) and keep your hair follicles healthy. Although rats and mice with low selenium start to go bald, this hasn’t been proved true for people. In fact, too much selenium can actually cause hair loss, as well as problems with your memory.

                    <p>You may know melatonin as the “sleep hormone.” Many people take it as a supplement for a good night’s rest or to cut jet lag. But a cream with melatonin can also boost hair growth or slow down hair loss. The reasons aren’t clear, but in a study, people who used a melatonin mixture on their scalp saw less hair loss in 30 days. Struggle with dandruff? Melatonin could help that too. As with all supplements, check with your doctor first.

                    <p>Daily doses of pumpkinseed oil taken by mouth could safely help bring your hair back. While more research is needed, one small study found that men who took four capsules of PSO each day for 6 months saw their hair count increase by 40%. One reason why? Like saw palmetto, pumpkinseed oil could block testosterone from changing into a compound called DHT, which is linked to hair loss.

                    <p>An extract made from its compounds may help a range of health issues, including hair loss. It may be a compound called EGCG that helps with hair growth. Researchers saw a difference when they gave balding rats green tea extract for 6 months. But that hasn’t been tested in people. Use green tea supplements with caution, though. Some contain other compounds that can make you sick.

                    <p>Doctors sometimes inject platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which comes from your own blood, to help with healing after surgery. PRP, which is rich in growth factors, might also help your hair grow. You give a little blood, and a lab spins it in a centrifuge to home in on platelet-rich plasma protein. You then get it injected into different points on your scalp. Many people who have PRP notice their hair grows back -- thicker than before.

You should get plenty of amino acids through a healthy diet. Good food sources include cottage cheese, fish, eggs, seeds and nuts, whole grains, and meat.

                    <p>In some cases, you can help your own hair loss with small and easy changes. Be gentle when you wash, dry, and brush your hair. Don’t yank! Limit the use of curling irons and hot rollers, which can weaken your hair. (So can often wearing your hair in a tight ponytail, braid, or bun.) If you smoke, now’s a great time to quit. Men who light up are more likely to have hair loss than those who don’t.

                    <p>Going through a rough time can sometimes lead to hair loss. Try to head it off by getting a better grip on your stress. Try techniques like meditation, deep breathing, guided imagery, relaxation exercises, or talking to a counselor. Exercise is also a great option. These are all easy to learn and proven to help ease tension. Keep in mind, the best treatment for your hair loss depends on the cause. Talk to your doctor for guidance.
